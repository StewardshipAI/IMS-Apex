# IMS-Apex 🚀

### **The Architect Layer & Performance Engine**
**IMS-Apex** is a high-performance reasoning engine that adopts expert personas to solve complex problems. It serves as the definitive "Architect" layer for the IMS ecosystem, bridging the gap between informal prompts and Top 2% technical execution through recursive task decomposition.

## 🛠 Features
* **Documentation-First Protocol:** Mandatory architectural commitment before code generation.
* **Recursive Task Decomposition:** Automatically breaks raw intent into hierarchical instruction sets.
* **Mandatory Audit-Gate:** Integrated "LLM-as-a-Judge" protocol to ensure elite standards.
* **YOLO Mode Ready:** Built for autonomous operation with `gemini-cli`.

## 🚀 The Protocol
1.  **Interrogate:** The engine stops and asks high-value questions to uncover the root goal.
2.  **Architect:** Generates a full `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` and directory map.
3.  **Execute:** Spawns specialized agents to fulfill narrow tasks with world-class precision.
4.  **Audit:** Final quality check before any code is committed.
