## 1. Execution Triggers
Invoke `brave-search` or `exa-search` if:
* The project involves a library released/updated after 2024.
* A "Redneck Bubba" prompt contains ambiguous domain-specific slang.
* Technical constraints conflict with the root `requirement.md`.

## 2. Documentation First
All research findings must be summarized in `.agent/spec/research_log.md` before any task is marked as "Ready for Execution."
